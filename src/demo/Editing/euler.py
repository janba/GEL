''' This script removes faces from a mesh until no more faces can be removed.
The mesh is loaded from a file given as the first argument to the script.
Faces are removed if they have two boundary halfedges or a single boundary. 
The point of the script is that it illustrates the proof that V-E+F=2 for 
genus 0 meshes by turning them into topological discs and then reducing them
to a single face. The script needs to be called with a mesh that has disc topology
and is triangulated.'''
