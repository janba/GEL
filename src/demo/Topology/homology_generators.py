# This script computes the set of homology generators for a mesh surface.
# Subsequently it cuts the mesh along these curves, producing a new mesh that is
# topologically equivalent to a disk. Note that the script does not handle 
# large meshes well, so it reduces the mesh using quadric simplification.
# The script also closes holes in the mesh before computing the homology generators.
#
# Usage: python homology_generators.py <mesh_file>
