            ---
            - m : the Manifold mesh or Graph we want to show.
            - g : the Graph we want to show. If you only want to show a graph, you
                can simply pass the graph as m, so the g argument is relevant only if
                you need to show both a Manifold _and_ a Graph.
            - mode : a single character that determines how the mesh is visualized:
                'w' - wireframe,
                'i' - isophote,
                'g' - glazed (try it and see),
                's' - scalar field,
                'l' - line field,
                'n' - normal.
                'x' - xray or ghost rendering. Useful to show Manifold on top of Graph
            - smooth : if True we use vertex normals. Otherwise, face normals.
            - bg_col : background color.
            - data : per vertex data for visualization. scalar or vector field.
            - reset_view : if False view is as left in the previous display call. If
                True, the view is reset to the default.
            - once : if True we immediately exit the event loop and return. However,
                the window stays and if the event loop is called from this or any
                other viewer, the window will still be responsive.

            Interactive controls:
            ---
            When a viewer window is displayed on the screen, you can naviagate with
            the mouse: Left mouse button rotates, right mouse button is used for
            zooming and (if shift is pressed) for panning. If you hold control, any
            mouse button will pick a point on the 3D model. Up to 19 of these points
            have unique colors.  If you pick an already placed annotation point it
            will be removed and can now be placed elsewhere. Hit space bar to clear
            the annotation points. Hitting ESC exits the event loop causing control
            to return to the script.
