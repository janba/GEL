     @brief Computes a polygonal mesh from a volumetric isocontour
     @param xform is the transformation from voxel indices back to the domain of the implicit being polygonized.
     @param grid is the voxel grid.
     @param tau is the threshold (or isovalue)
     @param make_triangles tells whether we output triangles (default: true) or quads (false)
     @param high_is_inside tells whether values greater than @c tau (defalut: true) are interior or exterior
     @param dual_connectivity should be true if you want dual contouring and fals for marching cubes connectivity
     @returns HMesh::Manifold - the resulting mesh.
     
     This function computes an iso surface using the method of dual contouring. For each voxel that is inside,
     it visits the six neighbors and outputs a quad if that neighbor is outside. This leads to a cuberille mesh.
     Afterwards, vertices are  placed on the isocontour by taking the average of the intersections of each of the four
     cube diagonals with the isosurface (approximated via linear interpolation). Dual contouring is very simple and leads
     to bette triangles than marching cubes. On the flip side, the vertex placement is arguably a bit more ad hoc.
