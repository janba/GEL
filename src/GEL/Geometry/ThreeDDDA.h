	/** \brief A ThreeDDDA is a class for traversing a grid of cells. 

      We wish to 
			enumerate all cells pierced by the ray going from a point p0 to a 
			point p1. It is dangerous to use floating point arithmetic since rounding
			errors may accumulate entailing that the 3ddda misses the cell containing
			the end point of the ray.
		
			Daniel Cohen-Or devised a technique for exact ray traversal using only 
			integer arithmetic. Using integer arithmetic, the computations are
			exact, but the ray must start and terminate exactly at grid points.
			I.e. the ray must start and terminate in cell corners.

			To overcome this issue, I have implemented a scheme where the ray
			starts and terminates on a grid that is finer than the cell grid.
			This means that we have fast and exact computations, and the ray can
			travel between two almost arbitrary points.

			A central problem with this scheme was that - in order to simplify
			things during the iterative traversal - the ray direction vector
			is always mirrored into the first octant (+x +y +z).  If the fine
			grid used for the ray start and end points is a superset of the
			grid points of the cell grid, this mirroring is almost impossible
			to implement correctly. This is due to the fact that the first
			cell on the right side of the y axis is called 0,y whereas the
			first cell on the left is called -1,y. This lack of symmetry makes
			things very difficult, but by ensuring that the endpoints of a ray
			can never lie on an a corner, edge, or face of the cell grid, we
			can make the problems go away.

			Hence, in this implementation, the fine grid is obtained by dividing 
			the cell into NxNxN subcells, but the grid points	of the fine grid lie 
			at the CENTRES of these subcells.
