     number of non-overlapping (local) separators

     This function finds a number of local separators by using a local front
     propagation method where we iteratively find the point closest to a sphere and
     then expand the sphere to contain the points (when needed).  When the front
     (i.e.  vertices connected to those already found) splits in two, we know that
     at least locally, the found vertices form a separator.  This separator is then
     made minimal by stripping away vertices until no more can be removed without
     rejoining the fronts.  This process is then repeated as many times as required
     by the input parameters, and, finally, the local separators produced are packed
     greedily, and the resulting vector of node sets is returned.

     exacly one node set.  The skeleton is then easy to find.  Each  (augmented) node set begets
     a vertex of the skeleton, and whenever two vertices belonging to different node sets are
     connected by an edge, we connect the corresponding skeletal vertices.  Normally, we have
     merge=true and all of the thriangles in the graph are reduced to Steiner-like vertices.  The
     graph structure has a color associated with vertices, and we color the Steiner vertices red.
